Implemented a highly efficient Inventory Management System that leverages a robust technology stack, including Java, MySQL, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA. This system has been meticulously crafted to streamline operations and significantly enhance inventory control for businesses. By integrating the power of these technologies, the system provides a seamless and user-friendly interface for inventory tracking, ordering, and management. To ensure the system's reliability and robustness, I employed rigorous testing methodologies, utilizing JUnit and Mockito for both unit and integration testing. This comprehensive testing approach has resulted in 95% test coverage, ensuring that the system functions flawlessly and meets the highest standards of quality and performance. Overall, this Inventory Management System represents a significant achievement in optimizing business operations and improving inventory management efficiency.
